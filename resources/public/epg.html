    <h2>EPG Software Development: Advancing Entomological Research</h2>

    <p class="description">
      During the Summer of 2025, I contributed to the ongoing development of an Electropenetrography (EPG) signal analysis software, building upon the foundational work of previous clinic teams. This project is crucial for entomological research, enabling the detailed analysis of insect feeding behaviors on various hosts.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      My primary focus was on significantly enhancing the software's Graphical User Interface (GUI) and integrating real-time data capabilities. I was responsible for rewriting the entire GUI using PyQtGraph, a powerful library that has better interactivity with large datasets compared to the previous PyQtChart implementation. This overhaul dramatically improved the user experience, offering researchers a more intuitive and responsive platform for data visualization and manual labeling.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      One of my key contributions was integrating a live recording view that connects the software directly to the engineering-side EPG hardware. This allows researchers to monitor insect feeding behavior in real time, an important capability for active experiments. I developed the interface to stream voltage data from the device using a background thread, which received incoming signals at 100 Hz (a set rate of the engineering EPG board). To optimize performance and memory usage, I updated the GUI display at 60 Hz and deferred appending data to the main NumPy array (a data structure necesssary for efficient slicing, used for processing only rendered data on the screen) until the buffer was flushed, avoiding the high cost of frequent O(n) array operations.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      I also led the development of many usability-focused features for researchers. These included interactive comment markers with hover previews, keyboard shortcuts like pressing “B” to set a baseline, and intuitive tools to merge or delete label regions. I implemented autosave functionality on exit, as well as automatic backup files that self-delete after three days to prevent data loss.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Since the program initially had no entry point, I also built an app launcher widget that lets users start a new recording, upload an existing one, or configure settings, making the tool feel more like a complete, ready-to-use application for deployment.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Beyond the GUI, our team also dedicated significant effort to refining the underlying Machine Learning (ML) models. While previous iterations focused on mosquito data, we successfully adapted and fine-tuned these models to work effectively with sharpshooter data (around 20x longer than mosquito data). This expansion is vital for broadening the software's applicability to a wider range of agricultural pests, addressing a critical need for our USDA liaisons.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The success of this project extended beyond initial development. Our software, complete with a 30-page user guide manual that I helped to author, is actively being used by entomological researchers at Auburn University and the USDA. This provided our team with invaluable real-world software engineering experience. We received bug reports and feature requests from our users, and we were responsible for debugging, creating, and shipping updated versions of the software. This process of iterative development and direct user support was a foundational experience in understanding the full software development lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      This project has significantly strengthened my skills in:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <strong>GUI Development:</strong> Designing and implementing complex, interactive user interfaces for scientific data visualization.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-time Data Integration:</strong> Connecting software directly to hardware for live data streaming and display.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Machine Learning Model Adaptation:</strong> Fine-tuning and validating existing ML models for new datasets and species.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaborative Software Engineering:</strong> Working within an ongoing project, extending existing codebases, and delivering impactful features for scientific research within a deadline.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">
      This work provides a robust and extensible foundation for future EPG analysis, making advanced machine learning tools more accessible and efficient for entomologists.
