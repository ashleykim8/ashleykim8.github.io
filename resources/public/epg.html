    <h2>EPG Software Development: Advancing Entomological Research</h2>
    <img src="./images/labelview.png" alt="research poster for epg software" class="image"/>
    
    <p class="description">
      During the Summer of 2025, I contributed to the ongoing development of an Electropenetrography (EPG) signal analysis software, building upon the foundational work of previous clinic teams. This project is crucial for entomological research, enabling the detailed analysis of insect feeding behaviors on various hosts.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      My primary focus was on significantly enhancing the software's Graphical User Interface (GUI) and integrating real-time data capabilities. I was responsible for rewriting the entire GUI using PyQtGraph, a powerful library that better interactivity with large datasets compared to the previous Chart.js implementation. This overhaul dramatically improved the user experience, offering researchers a more intuitive and responsive platform for data visualization and manual labeling.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      A key personal contribution was the integration of a live recording view, directly connecting the software to the engineering-side EPG device. This feature provides researchers with real-time insights into insect feeding, a critical advancement for active experiments. This involved developing the necessary interfaces to stream voltage data from the hardware and ensuring the GUI could dynamically refresh to display incoming information.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Beyond the GUI, our team also dedicated significant effort to refining the underlying Machine Learning (ML) models. While previous iterations focused on mosquito data, we successfully adapted and fine-tuned these models to work effectively with sharpshooter data. This expansion is vital for broadening the software's applicability to a wider range of agricultural pests, addressing a critical need for our USDA liaisons.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The success of this project extended beyond initial development. Our software, complete with a 30-page user guide manual that I helped to author, is actively being used by entomological researchers at Auburn University and the USDA. This provided our team with invaluable real-world software engineering experience. We received bug reports and feature requests from our users, and we were responsible for debugging, creating, and shipping updated versions of the software. This process of iterative development and direct user support was a foundational experience in understanding the full software development lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The project highlights several key features that demonstrate a professional approach to software development:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <strong>Backwards Compatibility:</strong> I developed a Legacy Data Converter to ensure that data from previous versions of the software remained usable, showcasing a commitment to long-term software support and user data integrity.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Configurability and User Experience:</strong> The application offers extensive user customization, including a light/dark theme, adjustable data line appearance, and the ability to toggle various display options. We also implemented keyboard shortcuts to improve efficiency for power users.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Robust Error Handling:</strong> The user manual includes a detailed troubleshooting and FAQ section, instructing users on how to report errors with terminal output, which demonstrates an intentional design for debugging and maintenance.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modular Design:</strong> The separation of the main application and the data converter into distinct executables points to a modular and scalable software architecture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">
      This project has significantly strengthened my skills in:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <strong>GUI Development:</strong> Designing and implementing complex, interactive user interfaces for scientific data visualization.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-time Data Integration:</strong> Connecting software directly to hardware for live data streaming and display.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Machine Learning Model Adaptation:</strong> Fine-tuning and validating existing ML models for new datasets and species.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaborative Software Engineering:</strong> Working within an ongoing project, extending existing codebases, and delivering impactful features for scientific research within a deadline.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">
      This work provides a robust and extensible foundation for future EPG analysis, making advanced machine learning tools more accessible and efficient for entomologists.
