    <h2>Interactive Google Calendar API Script</h2>

    <p class="description">
      For this project, I led the development of a Python script designed as an interactive platform to communicate with the user's Google Calendar API. This script empowers users to manage their public-facing Google Calendar locally through their terminal, offering robust functionalities to add, modify, and query events without needing browser access.

      As the <b>team lead</b>, my primary responsibility was to ensure the successful delivery of the project within established deadlines. This involved overseeing the development lifecycle, fostering clear communication, and actively contributing to the technical implementation. I spearheaded the integration of core API interactions, setting up robust authentication flows and designing efficient logic for event management.

    <p class="description">
      A significant challenge arose when a team member proposed an ambitious chatbot integration for natural language event creation. While innovative, it became evident that this feature was outside the scope of our project timeline and resources. As team lead, I facilitated a critical re-evaluation of our priorities. We proactively dedicated some time to research its feasibility alongside our original objectives, establishing a clear understanding that its implementation would only be pursued if we completed our core functionalities significantly ahead of schedule. This experience was instrumental in honing my ability manage project scope, and lead a team towards focused, deliverable outcomes without compromising quality or deadlines.
